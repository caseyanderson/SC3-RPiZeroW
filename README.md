# SC3-RPiZeroW
a collection of SuperCollider3 applications/examples for the Raspberry Pi Zero W

Assumes that readers are prototyping on a laptop, deploying to a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and have built supercolliderStandaloneRPI1
 as described [here](https://github.com/redFrik/supercolliderStandaloneRPI1). Also assumes usage of a USB Audio Adapter (I use [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1475), it's fine / cheap).
